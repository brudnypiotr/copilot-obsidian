## LLM Wiki Pattern

**Author:** Andrej Karpathy
**Source:** https://github.com/karpathy
**Use:** The core architecture — using an LLM to build and maintain a structured wiki from raw sources — is based on the LLM Wiki pattern Karpathy described publicly. The upstream `claude-obsidian` (and this fork) are independent implementations; no code or content from Karpathy's repositories was copied.
